# SQL-EDA-on-Food-Prices-in-India
The data is fetched from Humanitarian Data Exchange. It is from World Food Programme and has price details of different commodities from 1994 to Jan 2024. 
However, the data from 2024 is not sufficient for data exploration. Hence I have considered data till 2023 for EDA. With this, I have tried to analyze the changes in the prices over a period of time.
